    .RULES
		- Views have dedicated catalog for triggers, names must be:
            - instead_of_insert <- INSTEAD OF INSERT
            - instead_of_update <- INSTEAD OF UPDATE
            - instead_of_delete <- INSTEAD OF DELETE

            CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER <trigger_name>
            INSTEAD OF INSERT ON <view_name>
            FOR EACH ROW
            EXECUTE FUNCTION <function_name>;
