Management view allows to manually trigger fund quotation download and investment result re-calculation. 
As the data kept in a database like quotation and investment results is full recoverable,
there are also buttons to delete quotation and results in order to perform all calculation steps from scratch in case of any errors.

Consists of following components:
- **PostgreSQL** - Database to store fund quotation and investment results
- **Flask** - Backend app which downloads fund quotation from Analizy.pl and calculates investment results
- **Grafana** - Visualization of the results
- **Checker** - On startup imports investment configuration to the system. 
During the system runtime it is responsible for checking if there are new fund quotation available, 
triggers **Flask** to download them, and recalculate the results.
- **Loki** - Log server to capture logs from application components.
- **Promtail** - Log scraper, scrapes logs generated by apps and send them to **Loki**


## Startup
Run `Re-build_from_scratch.sh` script, which will build docker images, and start docker compose.
During the application startup sample investment config will be inserted to the system, and fund quotation will be downloaded from Analizy.pl to calculate refunds.
